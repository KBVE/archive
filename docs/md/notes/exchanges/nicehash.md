- NiceHash - Cryptocurrency Mining/Exchange

- Premise: The idea here is that you are reselling your GPU/CPU hashes for [bitcoin / BTC](btc.md). You will not be mining bitcoin directly, but rather letting entities "rent" your equipment through a time-based fee; the "renter" will then use your equipment to mine alternative coins.
  
- KBVE: We use NiceHash to organize and manage our mining equipment, with the bitcoin going to a [wallet](wallet.md) that then indefinitely holds the bitcoin. The crypto held will not be sold but rather leveraged and/or used to generate interest on the asset. 
	- Cold Storage -
	- Asset Leverage / Interest - 
 
- - Payout:
	- BTC - Nicehash does support lighting network, which helps reduce the cost to transfer the cryptocurrency. We recommend that you keep no more than $xxx of any cryptocurrency within a hot wallet. 
- Hack Incident: 
  - 12/6/2017 - 4736 BTC was *hacked* during a breach ; 12/16/2020 - All stolen BTC was repaid. 

- Notes:
	- Mining Address - ```3KQ3nyW8NqRwTFLzMjzqJH2vyX7ZkV7qbL```
		- This is address is important when setting up multiple miners, as its the public id for your hashes. 
	- Electrical Wiring / Costs
		- Extremely important to account for the voltage and power that your equipment will be utilizing. 
		- Make sure to mark the electrical cost per kWh that your utility provider charges, as certain equipment might not be worth the cost to operate.

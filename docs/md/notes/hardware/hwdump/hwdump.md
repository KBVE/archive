# Hardware Dump
- These are notes that are from older pieces of equipment that are no longer utilized. We will do our best to keep these notes alive on the internet, for edge cases , someone runs into problems, wants to up-cycle them, ect...
- Any notes under HWDump will not be maintained but any requests to edit/pull will be granted.

- [AdamTheAutomator - MD to HTML](https://adamtheautomator.com/convert-markdown-to-html/) - June seems to break down several ways we could automatically convert the MD files into HTML files. 
- [Github - Klayton's MD to JSON ](https://github.com/klaytonfaria/markdown-json) - This seems to conver the MD files into JSON.

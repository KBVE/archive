# MD Conv
- One of the goals will be to convert the MD into HTML and JSON Files.
- [AdamTheAutomator - MD to HTML](https://adamtheautomator.com/convert-markdown-to-html/) - June seems to break down several ways we could automatically convert the MD files into HTML files. 
- 
- [Github - Klayton's MD to JSON ](https://github.com/klaytonfaria/markdown-json) - This seems to conver the MD files into JSON. 
- Plugin? That might make it easier to tag / markdown text / backlink.

- The issue with the conversation within the CSS. The current bug seems to be in how the layout is setup, I am suggesting that we revert the template source code. It seems to fail to deliver a proper mobile version of the static files.

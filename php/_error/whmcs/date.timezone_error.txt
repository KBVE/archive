Since it is an nginx webserver, we have to edit the php.ini file in php-fpm folder.
Double check if you are using php fpm.
-> cd /etc/nginx/sites-enabled
-> nano file_of_domain
Okay look at the location ~ \.php$ section, you might see /var/run/php/php7.4-fpm.sock (depending on the php version).
Note it is 7.4
Now edit the php file.
-> cd /etc/php/
Check the version, in this case 7.4 and we are using fpm.
-> cd /etc/php/7.4/fpm
-> nano php.ini
Then search [Date] , and set it (based upon) -> https://www.php.net/manual/en/timezones.php be sure to click the 

date.timezone = "America/New_York"
date.timezone = "Asia/Pyongyang"

Close out and make sure to reload!
-> sudo service php7.4-fpm reload

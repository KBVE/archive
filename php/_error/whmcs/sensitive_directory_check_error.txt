Okay. We are using Nginx because ... really? Apache? I wont hate but.
-> cd /etc/nginx/ 
Then go to sites-enabled or sites-available
-> nano file_of_domain
Go into the server block and under [server_name] add denial of /vendor/ folder using this below

#WHMCS Block
#[START]
    location ^~ /vendor/ {
        deny all;
        return 403;
    }
#[END]

Afterwards run
-> nginx -t
Make sure everything is okay then run
-> systemctl reload nginx
-> systemctl restart nginx
~OR~
-> service nginx reload
-> service nginx restart


#Also we will have a fully secured and safeR nginx conf file, with these additions and more later on.
